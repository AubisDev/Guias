# Componentes con Lazy Loading

Cuando se quiere mostrar un componente cuando este en viewport visual del usuario, entonces es cuando se utiliza este el Defferable Views. Para ello angular utiliza el @defer(on 5643ewa viewport){ // Elemento a mostrar}. Sin embargo tambien esta formado por otros decoradores como @placeholder y el @loading{}. Un ejemplo de como usarlo seria:

### app.components.ts

```
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {CommentsComponent} from './comments.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>How I feel about Angular</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest deferrable view
          feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and most ergonomic it could possibly
          be. The Angular community is also filled with amazing contributors and experts that create
          excellent content. The community is welcoming and friendly, and it really is the best
          community out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't express enough how much I enjoy working with Angular. It offers the best developer
          experience I've ever had. I love that the Angular team puts their developers first and
          takes care to make us very happy. They genuinely want Angular to be the best framework it
          can be, and they're doing such an amazing job at it, too. This statement comes from my
          heart and is not at all copied and pasted. In fact, I think I'll say these exact same
          things again a few times.
